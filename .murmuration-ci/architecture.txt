Website Requirements
Content Management: It is probably vital to have a CMS (content management system) so that you can always update and maintain the different sections of the website like tutorials, projects and support.
User Interaction: Users could communicate by leaving comments, talking in forums, or asking for feedback.
Cloud Provider and Services
In terms of requirement and the scalability issues, a major cloud provider platform such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure will be better. In this scenario, I will select AWS as a cloud provider.
Architecture Design
Based on the requirements, i will design the architecture as follows:
Content Delivery: Use the Amazon CloudFront to cache and provide static assets like images, JS, and CSS files to users globally for better performance.
Configure S3 Bucket for Website Hosting.
